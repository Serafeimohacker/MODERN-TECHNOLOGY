<h1>MODERN TECHNOLOGY</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">THE TRANSISTOR</h2>
<p>The transistor is a solid-state semiconductor device , which finds various applications in electronics.
Some of which are amplification , voltage stabilization, frequency modulation, operation as a switch and as a variable ohmic resistor.
The transistor can, depending on the voltage with which it is biased, regulate the flow of electric current that it absorbs from a connected voltage source.
Transistors are manufactured either as separate electronic components or as parts of an integrated circuit.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">APPLE I(APPLE COMPUTER 1)</h2>
<p>The Apple I was an early personal computer,designed by Steven Wozniak initially for his own use.Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea to market the computer. It was sold as the first product of the Apple company starting in April 1976.</p>
<p>Its retail price was $ 666.66 .Approximately 200 units were produced. Unlike other home computers that were sold as kits, the Apple I was a pre-assembled circuit board containing about 30 chips . However, to make the computer functional, it required a case, power supply, keyboard , and a display . An optional board that provided a cassette tape interface for external data storage was later available for $75.</p>
<p>The Apple I is considered by some experts to be the first personal computer sold in a fully assembled form, but others believe that title rightfully belongs to other machines such as the Datapoint 2200.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi is a family of wireless networking technologies, based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards , widely used for local area networking of devices and Internet access . Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance , which limits the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that have successfully completed interoperability certification testing.As of 2010, the Wi-Fi Alliance had over 375 member companies worldwide.As of 2009, Wi-Fi integrated circuit chips were selling approximately 580 million units annually.Devices that can use Wi-Fi technologies include desktop and laptop computers,smartphones and tablets,smart TVs,printers,digital audio players, digital cameras,cars and unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
Devices typically support multiple versions. In order for devices to communicate, they must use a common version of Wi-Fi. Versions differ in the radio frequency range they operate in, the maximum data transfer rate, and other details. Historically, devices have listed the version using the IEEE standard they support. In 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced a simplified numbering system. Versions are largely backward compatible.</p>
